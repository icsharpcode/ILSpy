# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Supported are the latest released version as well as the latest preview/rc version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately to christoph.wille AT gmail.com. Please note that
we cannot guarantee a response time (*) although we will strive to get back to you within one business day. If you
do not hear back from Chris within a week, alternatively try to contact siegfriedpammer AT gmail.com.

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.

(*) We are an OSS project entirely run by volunteers and sometimes life<sup>tm</sup> will mean longer response times.
